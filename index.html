    <h2>ABOUT MY STUDIES</h2>
    <h3>HIGH SCHOOL</h3>
    <p>
      I attended high school at Stuyvesant High School in NYC. </p>
    <p> 
    There, I took a slew of classes that spanned a wide range of subjects, from the basic core courses of math, languages, and the sciences, but I also took courses in computer science, criminal law, and human reasoning. </p>
    <p> I knew for sure that I would not be pursuing any further studies in STEM, but was also still iffy as to what I did want to pursue by the time I graduated. </p>
      <h3>COLLEGE</h3>
      <p>
        I study journalism. I've taken JO200 (newswriting) and am taking JO150, a history of journalism course, and JO205, a photojournalism course, next semester. </p>
        <p>
        I also have a focus in English, meaning that I'll be taking many writing- and reading-heavy courses in the near future. </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy reading and writing, however I actually prefer copyediting to both of those activities. Through my coursework at BU, I hope to hone my abilities in critical reading, writing and editing so as to best suit my future endeavors.

    <h2>WHAT I LIKE TO DO</h2>
    <p>
      I definitely enjoy my personal time as much as I enjoy spending quality time with my friends and family.
    </p>
    <p> 
    As much as I like to party and go out, I also like to stay in and do some self-care. I love a good night of watching Netflix and doing some face masks, or winding down with coffee and a book. </p>
    <p> 
    In high school, I filled my free time with extracurriculars. I was captain for both the cheerleading and stunt teams, and also headed and participated in many dance crews throughout my time at Stuy. Though I miss cheer dearly, there just aren't opportunities for me to free-stunt or tumble; rather, I try to stay active by learning some choreographies on my own. </p>
